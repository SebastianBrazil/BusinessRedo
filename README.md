Business Redo Build

Description: This project is the full build of the Figma prototype this team created. It is for the business 'Abandoned Cat Team' and is fully functional through being built with HTML and CSS. 

1/3/24: Built out most of the header for the first page of the website. Imported all necessary fonts and most images. 1/4/24: Fully fleshed out the header and created the footer. The home page is still being built out, hopefully after that is completed the rest of the pages go by quickly. 1/5/24: The home page is completed, along with every page other than Services. Some more minor ajustments and the desktop will be completely finished. Mobile responsiveness has not been touched yet.
